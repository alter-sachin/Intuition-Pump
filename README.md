#Intuition-Pump

6 thinking hats

Bigger picture Product side :  The final end goal of this project would be
an application (Web or Native mobile) which can help users contact
over the network while providing the thinking functionality across
multiple Users ...Considering that the core implementation i.e the main work is understanding speech and providing tools to understand the same we start from a single point of contact approach which means a single/multiple user using one microphone to interact with our application

Current scenario : Single user to train and guide his thinking process.

1st order principle : You cant do much thinking with your bare brain.
In general discussions there is no structure involved which guides the group
to lead them to a final goal. At every moment arguments,emotional thinking,intuition,ideation occur concurrently and hence it is tough for them to
track where the discussion is going.
The topic of discussion is looked at from a haphazard point of view.
A structured approach to thinking would help see the problem from all points of views one by one and hence lead to a complete understanding of the problem at hand

The bigger picture : The final product of the six thinking hats app should be a meeting tool over the network with voice calls and other features that can be covered in a single mobile app interaction much like a conversation at a single point. 
This choice of a single point of contact and a single/multiple user interacting with the same point of contact is manifest of the principles of initially defining and building a user interface that works well with a single user and then can be transitioned to work for multiple users.
Hence we have decided that the initial setup will be of the form :

Single user and the app

The basic skeleton of all parts of the system controlled by our application is defined below. 
The purpose of the same is to define feedback loops that guide and drive the thinking of the user 
and make the functioning and onboarding process neither too tough nor too inept.
Introducing the mechanism so that it is not overwhelming

SEMANTICS OF THE APPLICATION :

Multiple users with  SPEECH ------> APPLICATION ---------> TEXT ||  BREAKDOWN INTO : creating a transcript of the meeting automatically:step 1
								||	             1. Classifcation
                                                                ||                   2. SUMMARY 
							        ||                   3. Tagging (by hats)
        feedback loop in form of speech or text                 ||                   4. Sentiments
	-----------------------------------FEEDBACK LOOP------   


SETTING UP THE MEETING : 

In every conversation/meeting we begin the conversation by setting up the agenda of meeting which is done by the BLUE HAT thinker in our case
, this part of the function will be entered through from the application 
Initial questions ASKED BY THE BLUE HAT 
we will know WHY WE ARE HERE ?Agenda of the meeting
Introduction :Questions that need solving
What do we want to be decided on at the end of the meeting ::::End result.

!!!!TIME TO THINK ABOUT STUFF IN BETWEEN TRANSITIONS!!! 

We try recommending the sequence of hats  that should be followed ::::
1. from the things he has said
2. Or ask him ourselves what he is talking about (fill details) and then tell him the sequence of hats to be followed....
know what they are talking about and tell everyone the structure of the meeting....

TIMING FOR EACH HAT : 5 MINUTES FOR EACH HAT OR EXTEND IT BASED ON WHAT THE BLUE HAT THINKS....

UI: CORD INSPIRATION

the app may need to recognise who is in the meeting?
not important because the conversation could be a monologue....if important then
different pitch voices identifies who the speakers are.
EXAMPLE RUN : WHITE BLACK AND GREEN....
FACTS AND INFORMATION  

COMMON CONDITIONS : EVERYONE GETS TIME TO THINK AND GIVE THEIR POV....
USER SWITCHES HATS BY TEXT OR SPEECHHHH

other hats ::: white yellow green black red 
each of these hats needs proper understanding to drive the 5 point text features better,
